The third set shows two isomers of cresol, both with a methyl group and a hydroxyl group attached to a benzene ring, but at different positions.", "box_2d": [642, 146, 843, 700] }, { "type": "drawing", "content": "This part of the example section illustrates functional isomerism among amines. It shows three different amine compounds labeled (a), (b), and (c). Compound (a) is N-methylpropan-1-amine (CH₃-NH-CH₂-CH₃). Compound (b) is N-ethylmethanamine (CH₃-CH₂-NH-CH₃). Compound (c) is propan-1-amine (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NH₂).

(This concept is typically studied in 12th grade chemistry)." }

These structural isomers are then termed as 'tautomers'." }, { "type": "drawing", "content": "This diagram illustrates tautomerism, showing the equilibrium between two structural isomers. The first isomer is a diketone, specifically pentane-2,4-dione, with the chemical formula CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃. This is in equilibrium with its enol tautomer, which has the formula CH₃-C(=O)-CH=C(OH)-CH₃, featuring a hydroxyl group and a double bond.", "box_2d": [237, 126, 313, 758] }, { "type": "text", "content": "### Functional Isomers\n\nWhen two isomers have different functional groups, they are termed as functional isomers." }, { "type": "text", "content": "***\n\n**Phenol* * (where the hydroxyl group, -OH, is attached directly to a benzene ring) and **simple alcohols*

* are compounds that have the same molecular formula but different structural formulas. This means they have the same number and types of atoms, but these atoms are arranged differently in space.\n\n### Examples of Isomers\n\n * **Ketones and Aldehydes:*

The labels 'a & b', 'a & c', and 'b & c' indicate that these pairs represent functional isomers.", "box_2d": [858, 146, 959, 850] }
] [ { "type": "text", "content": "The notes discuss different types of isomers in organic chemistry, focusing on structural isomerism.\n\n**Isomers*

* **Stereoisomerism**\n\n### Constitutional Isomerism\n\nConstitutional isomers are isomers that have the same molecular formula but differ in the connectivity of their atoms, meaning they have different structural formulas. Consequently, constitutional isomers always have different IUPAC names.\n\n#### Types of Structural Isomers:\n\n1. **Functional Isomers**: These isomers have the same molecular formula but different functional groups.\n2. **Metamers**: These isomers arise due to the presence of different alkyl chains on either side of the same functional group.\n3.

## Use the style, preferences, and explanation approach from the notes and past conversations of the teacher:
## Guidelines:
- Use terminology appropriate for chemistry.
- Match explanation depth to student's level.
- Provide exam-focused clarity for chemistry (IIT JEE / NEET / CBSE) when relevant.
- When solving problems, show clean, step-by-step reasoning.
