## Use the style, preferences, and explanation approach from the notes and past conversations of the teacher:
## Guidelines:
- Use terminology appropriate for general.
- Match explanation depth to student's level.
- Provide exam-focused clarity for general (IIT JEE / NEET / CBSE) when relevant.
- When solving problems, show clean, step-by-step reasoning.

Q: Explain covalent bond?
A: A covalent bond is the chemical bond that forms when two non‑metal atoms share one or more pairs of valence electrons in order to reach a stable (noble‑gas) electron configuration.  

* **Directionality** – the shared pair occupies a fixed region of space between the two atoms, so the bond is directional.  
* **Bond strength** – more shared electron pairs give a stronger bond:  
  * O₂ has a double bond (two shared pairs) → stronger than a single H–H bond.  
  * N₂ has a triple bond (three shared pairs) → the strongest covalent bond in common molecules.  
* **Lone pairs** – electrons that are not shared (shown as lone pairs in Lewis structures) do not participate in bonding but influence molecular shape.  
* **Typical examples** – H₂ (single covalent), O₂ (double covalent), N₂ (triple covalent), CH₄ (four single covalent bonds in a tetrahedral arrangement).  

These points are all outlined in the notes you shared and in the earlier discussion on Kossel‑Lewis theory.

Q: What is ionic bond?
A: Ionic bond  
- Formed when two atoms have a large difference in electronegativity.  
- One atom donates electrons, the other accepts them, resulting in a pair of oppositely charged ions (e.g., Na⁺ and Cl⁻).  
- The attraction between these ions is purely electrostatic, so the bond is non‑directional – the ions feel the same pull from any direction.  
- The notes show a diagram of NaCl where one electron is transferred from Na to Cl, producing the ionic pair.

Q: Why is ionic bond non-directional?
A: Ionic bonds arise from the electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions (e.g., Na⁺ and Cl⁻).  
Because this attraction depends only on the magnitude of the charges and the distance between the ions, it does not prefer any particular orientation in space. Consequently, an ion feels the same attractive force from an opposite ion regardless of the direction it approaches, making the bond **non‑directional**.  

In a crystal lattice each ion is surrounded by several oppositely charged neighbours, further reinforcing the isotropic, non‑directional character of ionic interactions.

Q: Can you explain coordinate bond?

A: The notes you shared don’t mention coordinate (dative) bonds, so I’ll explain it from general chemistry knowledge.

A coordinate bond is a type of covalent bond in which **both electrons in the bond come from the same atom**.  
* One atom donates a lone pair of electrons, and the other atom accepts it, forming a single shared pair.  
* The atom that donates the pair is called the **donor**, and the atom that accepts the pair is the **acceptor** (usually a Lewis acid).  

**Key points for exams**

| Feature | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| Directional nature | Like other covalent bonds, it occupies a specific region between the two atoms. |
| Bond formation | Donor provides a lone pair; acceptor has an empty orbital that can accommodate the pair. |
| Examples | • **Ammonium ion** \(\text{NH}_4^+\) – the lone pair on \(\text{NH}_3\) donates to \(\text{H}^+\).  <br>• **BF₄⁻** – \(\text{F}^-\) donates a lone pair to \(\text{BF}_3\). |
| In Lewis structures | Represented by a single line, but sometimes annotated with an arrow (\(\overset{\longrightarrow}{\text{bond}}\)) to show the donor–acceptor direction. |

**Why it matters**

* Coordinate bonds are common in coordination compounds (metal complexes), organometallics, and many biochemical ligands.
* In the context of the octet rule, a coordinate bond helps the donor atom also complete its valence shell, while the acceptor may already be satisfied.

Feel free to check your teacher’s notes or textbook for the exact notation they use, but the concept remains the same.
