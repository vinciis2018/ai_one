* More Zeff, stronger the bond O2 ⇄ (diagram showing O–O with lone pairs) => Double covalent bond is stronger than single covalent bond. ∴ In O2 one O has 2 e^-pairs i.e. total 4 e^-(H2 has only 1 e^-pair) N2 ⇄ lone pair (on each N) → N ≡ N (triple bond) lone pair = pair of e^-of valence shell which is not bonded. ( CH4 ) H |
H — C — H | H Central atom: C This structure is technically wrong (2 bond angles here? 90°) in reality 109°28' ## Diagrams [DIAGRAM: Ionic Bond]

Description: N ≡ N with lone pairs on each nitrogen Components:
-N atom
-N atom
-Triple bond between them
-Lone pairs on both nitrogens Notes: Lone pairs are the non-bonding valence electron pairs [/DIAGRAM] [DIAGRAM: CH4 tetrahedral structure] Title: CH4 molecule (tetrahedral arrangement)

There are 2 ways of achieving the noble gas configuration: 1) By transfer of e-2) By sharing of e-(covalent bonds) -Ionic bonds are generally formed when there is a high difference between EN of two species. These are formed by transfer of e-. -Covalent bonds are generally formed between non-metal atoms. (29.) Ionic compounds NaCl → Na⁺ + Cl⁻ Na₂O → 2 Na⁺ + O²⁻ Na⁺ (Note: The bottom portion appears to show a basic ionic compound illustration with NaCl and perhaps Na₂O.) ## Diagrams [DIAGRAM: Ionic bond] Title: Ionic bond formation (NaCl) Description: Shows transfer of one electron from sodium (Na) to chlorine (Cl), resulting in Na⁺ and Cl⁻ ions that are attracted electrostatically.

Title: Ionic Bond between Na+ and Cl-Description: Shows Na+ and Cl-with electrostatic attraction along a joining line Components:
-Na+ ion
-Cl-ion
-Arrow/line representing electrostatic attraction along the joining line Notes: Illustrates non-directional nature of ionic bonds and 3-D arrangement of ionic solids [/DIAGRAM] [DIAGRAM: H2 single covalent bond] Title: H2 molecule (single covalent bond)

Description: O=O with lone pairs shown around each Oxygen Components:
-O atom
-O atom
-Double bond between them
-Lone pairs on each O Notes: Double bond is stronger than a single covalent bond [/DIAGRAM] [DIAGRAM: N2 triple bond] Title: N2 molecule (triple bond)

## Use the style, preferences, and explanation approach from the notes and past conversations of the teacher:
## Guidelines:
- Use terminology appropriate for general.
- Match explanation depth to student's level.
- Provide exam-focused clarity for general (IIT JEE / NEET / CBSE) when relevant.
- When solving problems, show clean, step-by-step reasoning.


## Your student is in class 11 CBSE board who wants to learn physics for IIT JEE / NEET / CBSE exams preparation.
